# WishPlanet website codebase

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

This repository is in principal an old codebase we developed and the product (website) has run for years :telephone: :cd:. But now we decided to finally take the step and move into a Git Code repository :tiger2:, after having been on Microsoft VSTS Repository for 10+ years. After all - we have to admint, branching is easier here :blush: :smile: 

This product is a website where you can maintain your material gift wishes for example something you can hand-out to family members or friends when inviting to a birthday or closing up on christmas times. At least according to tradition in certain countries and cultures.

We as authors of the website and codebase has not intention in advocating or pushing for any culture change for anyone nor to start using material gifts as something that are not already part of their culture or traditions. And as such this is a hobby project with no cultural, religious or political intentions or agenda.

## ‚úÖ Status
Part of the website needs refactoring due to legacy style implementation, and hence we will gradually move things over and gradually refactor, before re-launch.

## üî£ License

We would like to keep it open source as a public codebase, but do not wish for others to copy and rebrand.

Hence we have decided to keep this codebase under the GNU Public General License (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

## üëÄ Technical Documentation

Since you are looking here, we would expect that you are more interested in what is under the hood rather than on the surface of the website, and hence the focus here will be the technical documentation. But we are not old-school documenting anything technical in a great detail. Rather keep documentation to a high level, to get an overall understanding of tools and architecture.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Getting involved

If there are any interest in contribute to the feature development or technical maturity and capabilities of the codebase and website, then we can be contacted here through the GitHub platform. We are not following up on this on a daily basis, so in advance apologies for potential logner response times on any personal interaction.
